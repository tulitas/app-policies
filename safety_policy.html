    <h1>Safety Standards and Child Protection Policy</h1>
    <p>This policy outlines our commitment to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all users. 
    Our application is intended for adults (18+) only. We have a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE).</p>

    <h2>1. Zero Tolerance for Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h2>
    <p>We are committed to the protection of children and strictly prohibit any content that depicts, promotes, or facilitates child sexual abuse or exploitation. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content showing child abuse, whether real or simulated.</li>
        <li>Content that sexualizes children in any way.</li>
        <li>Materials that depict the sexual exploitation of minors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Prohibited Content and Conduct</h2>
    <p>The following content and activities are strictly prohibited on our platform:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing or promoting any form of CSAE material.</li>
        <li>Engaging in predatory behavior or attempting to groom minors.</li>
        <li>Creating or distributing content that violates the safety and dignity of children.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Reporting and Moderation</h2>
    <p>We provide a clear mechanism for users to report any suspicious activity or prohibited content. 
    All reports are treated with the highest priority and will be reviewed immediately. 
    Our moderation team is trained to identify and act on violations of this policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Immediate Action and Enforcement</h2>
    <p>Upon identifying any content or conduct that violates this policy, we will take immediate and decisive action, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Removing the offending content.</li>
        <li>Permanently banning the user's account.</li>
        <li>Reporting the user and the content to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) or local agencies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Location Data</h2>
    <p>If you grant permission, we may collect and use your deviceâ€™s location data (precise or approximate) in order to provide certain features of the application. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nearby Services:</strong> We use your approximate location to detect your position and suggest services that are available near you.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Creation:</strong> When you create an event, your location data is used to associate the event with a place. This allows us to provide relevant offers or suggestions connected to that event.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Location data is used only for these purposes. It is not shared with third parties and is not used for advertising or marketing outside of the described functionality.</p>

    <h2>6. Commitment to Collaboration</h2>
    <p>We are dedicated to working with law enforcement and child safety organizations to combat the spread of harmful content. 
    We will cooperate fully with investigations and provide any necessary information to protect children.</p>
